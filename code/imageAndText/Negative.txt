A brick building, originally a stagecoach tavern, located near the corner of the Bethany Center Road and Raymond Road was the site selected, as it represented the geographical center of the county. (Wyoming County wasn\u2019t established until 1841.) In 1828 Genesee County constructed a stone building attached to the Poorhouse for the confinement of lunatics and a repository for paupers committed for misconduct.  The insane were also housed at the County Home until 1887 when the Board of Supervisors agreed to send \u201cpersons suffering with acute insanity&quot; elsewhere in the state.\n\nThe  Genesee County Poor Farm aka The County Home, was a self sufficient working farm and woods, spanning over 200 acres, providing  food and fuel, thus the actual cost to care for each person was low, about $1.08 per week per resident, back in 1871.\n\n  Residents were referred to as inmates (no matter why they were housed there) and those physically able-bodied would work the farm and many actually built and made wares to sell to help offset some of the living expenses.  The raising of Holsteins, pigs, draft horses, chickens and ducks, raising vegetable and fruit  crops, canning jams, jellies, meats, were all part of the chores, there was a bakery and even a wood shop where coffins were made (for use as needed and for sale to local mortuaries).\n\nThe County would bury those who had no family, and records indicate there was once a cemetery located on the property, but the particulars are almost nonexistent.  An 1886 Proceeding states \u201cThe burying ground we have improved by building a fence in front and grading and leveling the ground as much as could be done without injury to the graves.\u201d\n\n\n  The cemetery for the County Poorhouse has faded away as the stones crumpled, the grass grew and the forest replanted.  No one was around to care for those who had so long ago been forgotten.  These people, though they were poor, ill and sometime abandoned, do deserve to be remembered. An actual cemetery register or plot map has yet to be discovered.\n\nA memorial site was created in the Genesee County Park and on June 6, 2004  when five headstones, dated from 1887 to 1888, were returned to the County. The Genesee County Historians dedicated a historical marker honoring those who died while living in the County Home from 1827 until the facility was closed in 1974 (residents were relocated to new facilities in Batavia). \n', 'comments': [], 'title': u'Rolling Hills Asylum and Western Red Cedar for raised beds.'})

There are a lot of homeless people on the street and in the subway. The people shown here are unable to bath regularly so they smell. They are usually avoided unless someone is giving them money. The social structure that deals with this is the societal but also to a smaller degree the personal. This is my subway stop. In the past there may have been a homeless man sleeping there for a night and then leaving. On this day there were three. One of those men has been on the same bench for over a month. He is old, with white hair and a long beard. The law does not really supports this social harm but it does not help the people either. Sleeping on a bench outside might get them arrested, which for them would mean a place to sleep, food, and access to hygiene. But it is ridiculous that they have to be locked up to receive basic necessities. If they went to a shelter and there wasn't enough room, they would be turned away which shows a flaw in our society.\n \n- Rita S.", 'comments': [], 'title': u'Rita Shapsis'})
