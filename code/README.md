#### Set Up Instruction

To reproduce the main proect experiment, directly open Project.ipynb with notebook. All classifiers that are needed to detect image contents are already trained and saved. 

The Training code is included in BagOfVisualWords.ipynb. Attention to run this code because training on images costs time and needed to wait at least 30 minutes.

Code for searching and downloading data from Flickr is included in DataCollection.ipynb.
